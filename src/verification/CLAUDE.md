# src/verification — shared knowledge for every agent

This package implements the training-step verification protocol at test scale. Read this file
first. It pins the names, constants, encodings and interfaces that parallel tasks must agree
on. The design is settled in `docs/verification/`:

- `VERIFICATION_PROTOCOL_SPEC.md` is the protocol: checks 0–9 in §6 and security in §8.
- `VERIFICATION_PROTOCOL_REFERENCE_BLOCK.md` is the SmolLM2 instance. It has the forward
  pass (§3), the backward pass (§4), the matmul inventory (§5), the canonical leaf order (§6)
  and the MLP instance (§9).
- `DECISIONS_SETUP.md` §8.B holds the implementation-level decisions. Code comments cite them
  by ID (S9c, P8b) rather than restating them.
- `VERIFICATION_PARAMETER_SIZING.md` has the sizing formulas (§7–§9) and the worked values
  (§10).
- `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` has the task table (A1–A14, B1–B6).

If the code seems to need something these documents don't say, or contradict, **stop and
report it to the orchestrator**. Don't pick a protocol-level answer yourself. Implementation
details that don't change what is committed or checked are yours to choose.

## Working rules

- **Never edit `docs/verification/`**, and never push. Commit on your worktree's branch only.
- **Python.** Use the project venv at `/Users/amitainevo/Projects/pots-2.0/.venv/bin/python`
  (Python 3.14, torch 2.9.1, transformers 4.57.6, blake3 1.0.9, datasets 5.0.0,
  pytest 9). Install nothing. If you need a package, report it.
- **Tests.** Run from the repository (or worktree) root:
  `/Users/amitainevo/Projects/pots-2.0/.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/verification`.
  Each module gets `tests/verification/test_<module>.py`. Tests that load the real 135M model
  or run a full step carry `@pytest.mark.slow`, and the default run skips them
  (`-m "not slow"`). Keep the fast suite under about a minute.
- **Style.**
  - Use ordinary importable libraries with type hints and no import-time side effects (S7b).
  - Entry points read env vars through `config.py` and call library functions.
  - Comments are sparse, match the surrounding code, and cite decision IDs.
  - Follow `/Users/amitainevo/Projects/pots-2.0/writing-tenets.md` for prose.
- **Don't import** `src.model_loader`, `src.data_loader` or TRL. The verified path loads the
  model directly (§8.A.2).

Model shapes, from ref block §1: `L=30`, `d=576`, `d_f=1536`, `n_h=9`, `n_kv=3`, `d_h=64`,
`n_v=49152`, 272 weight tensors, 134,515,008 parameters, tied `W_E`.
At 4×128 tokens: `M = L·(21 + 6·n_s·n_h) + 3 = 7,113`, and there are 7,661 leaves.

## Environment variables (`config.py`), with test-scale defaults

All start with `VERIF_`. Scale is config only, never a code fork (§8.A.5).

| var | default |
|---|---|
| `VERIF_DEVICE` | `cpu` |
| `VERIF_MODEL` | `HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM2-135M-Instruct` |
| `VERIF_MODEL_REVISION` | `12fd25f77366fa6b3b4b768ec3050bf629380bac` |
| `VERIF_DATASET` | `tatsu-lab/alpaca` |
| `VERIF_DATASET_REVISION` | `dce01c9b08f87459cf36a430d809084718273017` |
| `VERIF_MASTER_DTYPE` / `VERIF_COMPUTE_DTYPE` | `float32` / `float32` |
| `VERIF_ATTN_IMPL` | `eager` |
| `VERIF_K` | `7` |
| `VERIF_BATCH` (`n_s`) / `VERIF_SEQ_LEN` (`n`) | `4` / `128` |
| `VERIF_STEPS` (`T`) | `10` |
| `VERIF_N_RECORDS` | `500` |
| `VERIF_ETA` | unset until C2 fixes it. A run that needs `η` fails if it's unset |
| `VERIF_THREADS` | `8` |
| `VERIF_SEED` | `0` |
| `VERIF_OUTPUT_DIR` | `trainer_output/verification` (gitignored) |

Data artifacts (`D`, `D̃`, manifest) are written to `$VERIF_OUTPUT_DIR/data/`, and the band
file to `$VERIF_OUTPUT_DIR/bands.json`.

## Canonical encoding (S9c, S9d, P1b, P8a). Nothing else enters a commitment

Header integers are big-endian and payloads are little-endian C-order raw bytes. There's no
JSON, no timestamps and no optional fields.

**Leaf tags (1 byte).** These values are an implementation pin, and any distinct values would
serve.

| tag | object |
|---|---|
| `0x01` | dataset record, token form (P1b) |
| `0x02` | weight tensor (the same tag in `W_t` and `W_{t+1}`, so chaining compares identical leaves) |
| `0x03` | matmul product `P_m` |
| `0x04` | MLP instance record, a float tensor with this tag |
| `0x10` | challenge label (not a leaf) |

**Dtype codes (1 byte):** `0x01` float32, `0x02` bfloat16, `0x03` float16, `0x10` int32.

**Tensor leaf:** `tag(1) ‖ dtype(1) ‖ ndim(1) ‖ dim_0(4) … dim_{ndim−1}(4) ‖ raw bytes`.
A float tensor with any NaN or Inf is rejected with an error, not canonicalised, and `-0.0` is
accepted (S9d).

**Token record:** `0x01 ‖ 0x10 ‖ ℓ(4) ‖ ids ‖ targets ‖ mask`, three int32 arrays of length `ℓ`.
- `ids[i]` is the input token at position `i`, and `targets[i]` is the next token.
- `mask[i]` is 1 exactly when `targets[i]` belongs to the response or the appended EOS (P1c).
- If the rendered prompt, response and EOS tokenize to `t_0 … t_ℓ`, then `ids = t[0:ℓ]` and
  `targets = t[1:ℓ+1]`. The record fits when `ℓ ≤ n = 128`.

**Challenge label:** `0x10 ‖ m(4) ‖ j(1)`. Here `m ∈ 1…M` is the product's 1-based position
in canonical product order, and `j ∈ 1…k` is 1-based. It is keyed by the step root `h`.

**Merkle (P9).**
- `H_leaf(x) = BLAKE3(0x00 ‖ x)` and `H_node(l, r) = BLAKE3(0x01 ‖ l ‖ r)`, with 32-byte
  digests.
- An unpaired node is promoted unchanged, the RFC 6962 split at the largest power of two below
  `n`.
- The same tree builds the step root `h` and the dataset root `h_D`.

**Challenge entries (P8b).** Take `BLAKE3(key=h).update(label)` as an XOF with `4·c_m` bytes.
Entry `i` is the little-endian uint32 `w` at bytes `4i…4i+3`, with `a = w >> 8`, giving
`r_i = (2a + 1 − 2²⁴)/2²⁴` in float32. The result is exact and has mean exactly 0.

## Step transcript: leaf order (ref block §6)

Leaf indices are 0-based:

```
[0, n_s)                      batch records, in batch order (encoded exactly as in h_D, P9b)
[n_s, n_s+n_w)                W_t: W_E; per layer γ_attn, W_q, W_k, W_v, W_o, γ_mlp, W_gate, W_up, W_down; γ_final
[n_s+n_w, n_s+n_w+M)          products P_1..P_M in canonical order (ref block §6 items 3–4)
[n_s+n_w+M, n_s+2n_w+M)       W_{t+1}, same order as W_t
```

Weight tensors are committed as the model holds them. Linear weights are `[o, i]`, as in
`nn.Linear.weight`.

Each product leaf is the product exactly as the spec's `P = A·B` defines it. Each `(s, h)`
member of a batched attention product is its own leaf, an `n×n` or `n×d_h` matrix. The
weight-gradient `G_x` is `[o, i]`, the same shape as `W_x`.

## Per-step check order (S6c revised at stage 4)

`4 → 7 → 2 → 6a → 5 → 6b`, the same order in every run. The verifier is byte-identical across
runs (S6a).

| step | check |
|---|---|
| 4 | batch anchor: each record leaf plus its path verifies into `h_D` at index `π(t)_i` |
| 7 | chaining: the `W_t` leaf hashes equal the previous step's `W_{t+1}` leaf hashes |
| 2 | commitment: recompute the root over all leaves and compare it with the claimed `h` |
| 6a | update identity, linear weights, from the committed `G_x` |
| 5 | matmul checks in canonical order, with the two tests of spec §6. Abort at the first failure |
| 6b | update identity for γ scales and `W_E` (`G_E^head + G_E^emb`), from the backward glue that check 5 replayed |

Check 3 isn't a separate pass. It is the rule that check 5's operands are rebuilt from
committed leaves. Checks 0 and 1 run at run start, and 8 and 9 at run end.

A rejection is reported as `(step, check_id, detail)`. The cheat harness compares it with the
declared expected point (S6b).

## Invariants: breaking any of these voids the result

1. **The verifier reads the transcript only through the `TranscriptStore` interface** (S3). It
   never touches a prover object, and it holds its own model instance built from the committed
   `W_t`.
2. **Glue is recomputed with the model's own modules** (S4b), for example
   `layer.input_layernorm(x)`. Never hand-write RMSNorm, softmax or RoPE.
3. **Determinism** (S4c):
   - `torch.use_deterministic_algorithms(True)`, threads pinned, TF32 off.
   - Seeds are set.
   - Dropout is asserted to be 0 on the loaded config.
4. **Plain SGD** (S8a): `torch.optim.SGD(lr=η, momentum=0, weight_decay=0)`, with no clipping
   and no schedule.
5. **Faults exist on the prover side only** (S6a): the batch trained on, hidden steps, and
   post-capture product perturbation. The verifier has no fault hooks.
6. **A captured tensor must not change after capture.** Check `_version` at commit time, and
   clone if needed.
7. **The verifier knows every leaf count; the prover never supplies it.** An RFC 6962 root and
   audit path don't bind the tree size: a leaf can have the same path in trees of different
   sizes, for example leaf 0 at n = 40 and n = 41. So `verify_path` takes `n_leaves` from the
   declared computation (`n_s + 2n_w + M` for `h`) or from the data manifest (`|D|` for `h_D`),
   never from the transcript.
